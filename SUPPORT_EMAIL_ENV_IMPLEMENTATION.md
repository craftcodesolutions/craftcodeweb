# Support Email Environment Variable Implementation

## Overview
Successfully converted all hardcoded support email references to use environment variables for better configuration management and deployment flexibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration
**File: `env.example`**
- Added `SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@craftcode.com` environment variable
- This provides a template for deployment-specific configuration

### 2. Files Updated

#### Frontend Components (Client-side)
- **`src/context/GlobalChatContext.tsx`**
  - Updated to use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL`
  - Added SUPPORT_EMAIL to useCallback dependencies for proper React hooks behavior
  - Default fallback: `'support@craftcode.com'`

- **`src/app/(dashboard)/(root)/_components/SupportSection.tsx`**
  - Updated email contact to use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL`
  - Default fallback: `'support@craftcode.com'`

#### Backend Services (Server-side)
- **`src/lib/contacts.ts`**
  - Updated ADMIN_EMAILS array to use `process.env.SUPPORT_EMAIL`
  - Updated supportEmail variable to use environment variable
  - Default fallback: `'support@craftcode.com'`

- **`src/lib/messageService.ts`**
  - Updated targetEmail to use `process.env.SUPPORT_EMAIL`
  - Default fallback: `'support@craftcode.com'`

- **`src/app/api/users/support/route.ts`**
  - Updated SUPPORT_EMAIL constant to use `process.env.SUPPORT_EMAIL`
  - Default fallback: `'support@craftcode.com'`

## Environment Variable Usage

### Client-side (Frontend)
```typescript
const SUPPORT_EMAIL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL || 'support@craftcode.com';
```
- Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side access
- Required for components that run in the browser

### Server-side (Backend)
```typescript
const SUPPORT_EMAIL = process.env.SUPPORT_EMAIL || 'support@craftcode.com';
```
- Standard environment variable access
- Used in API routes and server-side utilities

## Deployment Configuration

### Local Development
Add to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
# Support Email Configuration
SUPPORT_EMAIL=your-support@domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL=your-support@domain.com
```

### Production Deployment
Set environment variables in your hosting platform:
- `SUPPORT_EMAIL=your-support@domain.com`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL=your-support@domain.com`

## Benefits

✅ **Configuration Flexibility**: Easy to change support email per environment  
✅ **Security**: No hardcoded emails in source code  
✅ **Deployment Ready**: Different emails for dev/staging/production  
✅ **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for support email configuration  
✅ **Team Collaboration**: Each developer can use their own support email for testing  

## Backward Compatibility

All changes include fallback values (`'support@craftcode.com'`) to ensure the application continues working even if environment variables are not set.

## Testing

### Verify Implementation
1. **Check environment variables are loaded**:
   ```bash
   echo $SUPPORT_EMAIL
   echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL
   ```

2. **Test functionality**:
   - Guest chat system should route to configured support email
   - Support forms should use configured email
   - Admin detection should work with configured email
   - Contact lists should include configured support user

### Example Environment Setup
```bash
# .env.local
SUPPORT_EMAIL=test-support@craftcode.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL=test-support@craftcode.com
```

## Files Affected Summary

| File | Type | Change | Environment Variable Used |
|------|------|--------|--------------------------|
| `env.example` | Config | Added SUPPORT_EMAIL | Template |
| `GlobalChatContext.tsx` | Frontend | Replaced hardcoded email | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL` |
| `SupportSection.tsx` | Frontend | Replaced hardcoded email | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL` |
| `contacts.ts` | Backend | Replaced hardcoded emails | `SUPPORT_EMAIL` |
| `messageService.ts` | Backend | Replaced hardcoded email | `SUPPORT_EMAIL` |
| `support/route.ts` | API | Replaced hardcoded email | `SUPPORT_EMAIL` |

## Next Steps

1. **Set environment variables** in your deployment environment
2. **Update team documentation** with new environment variable requirements
3. **Test thoroughly** in different environments (dev/staging/production)
4. **Consider adding validation** to ensure support email is properly configured
